SOCIAL TIDES RESEARCH REPORT - AI PLASTIC DETECTION ANALYSIS
===========================================================

RESEARCH OVERVIEW:
Our AI development focuses on automatic detection of marine plastic debris using
satellite imagery and advanced machine learning algorithms. This represents a
significant advancement in environmental monitoring capabilities.

   - Sentinel-1 SAR data (all-weather capability)
   - Sentinel-2 optical data (spectral analysis)
   - Combined processing for enhanced reliability

2. FLOATING DEBRIS INDEX (FDI):
   - Physically-based spectral algorithm
   - Specifically designed for plastic detection
   - Validated in scientific literature

3. MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION:
   - Multiple spectral indices analysis
   - Confidence scoring system
   - Adaptive threshold determination

4. WATER MASKING:
   - Focused analysis on water areas only
   - Eliminates false positives from land
   - NDWI-based water detection
