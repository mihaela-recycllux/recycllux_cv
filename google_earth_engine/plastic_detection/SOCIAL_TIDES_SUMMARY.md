# RECYLLUX AI DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY FOR SOCIAL TIDES

## Research Overview

We have developed a comprehensive AI-based plastic detection system using satellite imagery and advanced machine learning algorithms. This system represents a significant advancement in environmental monitoring capabilities, enabling automated detection and quantification of marine plastic debris from space.

## Algorithm Development

### 1. Original Sentinel Hub Implementation
Our initial research focused on three main algorithms using the Sentinel Hub API:

**A. FDI (Floating Debris Index) Detection (`01_sentinel2_plastic_fdi_detection.py`)**
- Physically-based spectral index specifically designed for floating plastic detection
- Formula: R_NIR - R_baseline (where baseline is interpolated from Red and SWIR bands)
- Includes comprehensive water masking to eliminate false positives from land areas
- Generates confidence maps and area quantification

**B. Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (`02_sentinel_data_fusion.py`)**
- Combines Sentinel-1 SAR (radar) and Sentinel-2 optical data
- SAR data provides all-weather detection capability (works through clouds)
- Calculates 15+ spectral and backscatter indices for comprehensive analysis
- Creates machine learning-ready datasets for advanced classification

**C. Comprehensive Detection System (`03_comprehensive_plastic_detection.py`)**
- Integrates FDI method with machine learning classification
- Applies anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm
- Creates ensemble detection by combining multiple methods
- Provides confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation

### 2. Google Earth Engine Migration
Recognizing the need for scalable, cloud-based processing, we migrated our algorithms to Google Earth Engine:

**Key Advantages:**
- Global satellite data access without download requirements
- Cloud-based processing for handling large areas
- Real-time analysis capabilities
- Scalable to continental or global monitoring

**New Implementation Features:**
- `comprehensive_plastic_detection_ee.py`: Main analysis engine
- `quick_plastic_analysis.py`: Fast coordinate checking tool
- `batch_plastic_analysis.py`: Large-scale monitoring capability
- `analyze_social_tides_coordinates.py`: Specific analysis for your coordinates

## Technical Specifications

### Multi-Sensor Approach
- **Sentinel-2 L2A**: 10m resolution optical imagery (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR bands)
- **Sentinel-1 IW**: 10m SAR imagery (VV and VH polarizations)
- **Temporal Analysis**: 30-day composite windows for robust detection
- **Spatial Coverage**: Configurable buffer zones (1-20 km radius)

### Detection Methods
1. **Floating Debris Index (FDI)**: Primary spectral-based detection
2. **Spectral Classification**: Multi-threshold analysis with confidence scoring
3. **SAR Analysis**: Surface roughness and backscatter characteristics
4. **Ensemble Detection**: Weighted combination of all methods
5. **Water Masking**: NDWI-based water detection to focus analysis

### Performance Characteristics
